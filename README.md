It's an Jumbo Mess T.T

This build is for Fightcade Linux as of right now since Windows Support should be an easy transtitions.


What's in the build Most of it is code that I originally made to see if it can calibrate and work which it does, You need Python and some Other Repo to get it up. 

I sadly had to use AI since I didn't want to put any malware or bloated Code on someone elses PC so these verison should be small. I hope you enjoy
