3rd Strike Advanced - Final Project
===================================
This is the full 3rd Strike bot project.

After extracting, it is recommended to rename the folder to **.3rd_Strike** 
(add a leading dot) so it remains hidden on Linux to avoid accidental deletion.

How to use:
1. Move or rename the folder to ~/.3rd_Strike for a hidden installation.
2. Run the launcher script (launch_3rd_strike_bot.sh) or open a terminal and run:
     python3 3rd_strike_bot.py
3. Follow the on-screen menus to calibrate, detect gamepads, and start the bot.

Dependencies (install as needed):
  sudo apt install xdotool tesseract-ocr ffmpeg python3-tk
  pip install pygame pynput mss opencv-python numpy pillow pytesseract
